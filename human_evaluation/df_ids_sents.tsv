28045_3	According to James Bamford, the NSA had picked up communications of al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi back in 1999, but had been hampered by internal bureaucratic conflicts between itself and the CIA, and did not do a full analysis of the information it passed on to the agency.
28045_4	For example, it only passed on the first names, Nawaf and Khalid.
28045_5	Bamford also claims that the CIA's Alec Station (a unit assigned to bin Laden) knew that al-Mihdhar was planning to come to New York as far back as January 2000.
28045_6	Doug Miller, one of three FBI agents working inside the CIA station, tried to send a message (a CIR) to the FBI to alert them about this, so they could put al-Mihdhar on a watch list.
28045_7	His CIA boss, Tom Wilshire, deputy station chief, allegedly denied permission to Miller.
28045_8	Miller asked his associate Mark Rossini for advice; Rossini pressed Wilshire's deputy but was rebuffed also.
28045_9	Bamford also claims that al-Mihdhar and Hazmi wound up living with Abdussattar Shaikh for a time to save money.
28045_10	Shaikh was, coincidentally, an FBI informant, but since they never acted suspiciously around him, he never reported them.
28045_11	The CIA Bangkok station told Alec Station that Hazmi had gone to Los Angeles.
28045_12	None of this information made it back to the FBI headquarters.

17173785_1	On 6 February 2008, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York released its conclusions.
17173785_2	Those conclusions were based on an initial autopsy that occurred 23 January 2008, and a subsequent complete toxicological analysis.
17173785_3	"The report concluded that Ledger died ""as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine""."
17173785_4	"It added: ""We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescribed medications. """
17173785_5	While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for insomnia, anxiety, pain or common cold symptoms (doxylamine), the vast majority of physicians in the U.S. are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam, alprazolam and temazepam) to a single patient, let alone to prescribe such medications to a patient already taking a mix of oxycodone and hydrocodone.
17173785_6	Although the Associated Press and other media reported that police estimated Ledger's death occurred between 1:00 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. on 22 January 2008, the Medical Examiner's Office announced that it would not publicly disclose the official estimated time of death.
17173785_7	The official announcement of the cause and manner of Ledger's death heightened concerns about the growing problems of prescription drug abuse or misuse and combined drug intoxication (CDI).
17173785_8	In 2017, Jason Payne-James, a forensic pathologist, asserted that Ledger might have survived if hydrocodone and oxycodone had been left out of the combination of drugs that the actor took just prior to his death.
17173785_9	He furthermore stated that the mixture of drugs, combined with a possible chest infection, caused Ledger to stop breathing.

32927_2	In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter, which outlined British and American goals for the postwar world.
32927_3	In late August the British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian Corridor, Iran's oil fields, and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or British India.
32927_4	By October Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing.
32927_5	A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive.
32927_6	Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential.
32927_7	The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended.
32927_8	By early December, freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.
32927_9	This, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army, allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west.

715909_3	"In 1982, a new, simplified orthography, known as ""monotonic"", was adopted for official use in Modern Greek by the Greek state."
715909_4	"It uses only a single accent mark, the acute (also known in this context as tonos, i.e. simply ""accent""), marking the stressed syllable of polysyllabic words, and occasionally the diaeresis to distinguish diphthongal from digraph readings in pairs of vowel letters, making this monotonic system very similar to the accent mark system used in Spanish."
715909_5	The polytonic system is still conventionally used for writing Ancient Greek, while in some book printing and generally in the usage of conservative writers it can still also be found in use for Modern Greek.

35507_1	A number of tools exist that crawl through a website to find pages that return 404 status codes.
35507_2	These tools can be helpful in finding links that exist within a particular website.
35507_3	The limitation of these tools is that they only find links within one particular website, and ignore 404s resulting from links on other websites.
35507_4	As a result, these tools miss out on 83% of the 404s on websites.
35507_5	One way around this is to find 404 errors by analyzing external links.
35507_6	One of the most effective ways to discover 404 errors is by using Google Search Console, Google Analytics or crawling software.

71416_1	"Dune has been called the ""first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale""."
71416_2	"Herbert hoped it would be seen as an ""environmental awareness handbook"" and said the title was meant to ""echo the sound of 'doom'""."
71416_3	"It was reviewed in the bestselling countercultural Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 as a ""rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community”."
71416_4	After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences.
71416_5	Dune responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life forms adapted to live with limited water.
71416_6	Dune was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as A Door into Ocean (1986) and Red Mars (1992).
71416_7	Environmentalists have pointed out that Dune's popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international Earth Day.

153557_3	Live!, a live album recorded during Collins's Seriously, Live!
153557_4	World Tour in 1990.
153557_5	Their claim was they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved.
153557_6	On 19 April 2000, the High Court in London ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins.
153557_7	The amount that Collins was seeking was halved, and Satterfield and Davis (who originally brought the suit forward in California) would not have to repay any of it.
153557_8	"The judge agreed with Collins' argument that Satterfield and Davis should have been paid for only the five tracks on which they performed, including the hit ""Sussudio""."

5058690_5	Studies of 9/11’s economic effects show the Manhattan office real-estate market and office employment were less affected than first feared, because of the financial services industry's need for face-to-face interaction.

299534_4	Specifically, Clinton was asked under oath about Monica Lewinsky in the Jones suit, denied having ever had sexual relations with her, and was accused of perjury after evidence of sexual contact was exposed.
299534_5	The Jones lawsuit also led to a landmark legal precedent by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled that a sitting U.S. president is not exempt from civil litigation for acts committed outside of public office.
